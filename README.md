# Kicad-symbols
These are some Kicad schematic symbols of common parts that the USST uses.
To use them:
- Clone the repo somewhere on your computer
- In Eeschema, go to Preferences->Component Libraries
- In the "user defined search path" section click the "Add" button.
- Choose the folder that you cloned the repo to.
- In the "Component library files" section, click the "Add" button.
- Select the file "USST-parts.lib" in the folder that you just added.
- Press "OK" :smile:

Check github, and pull whenever you see updates, especially if you plan on adding/modifying parts.
Let people know what you are doing before you make modifications, to minimize library breakage. (Or use branches?)
